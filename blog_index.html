        <p>Object Oriented Programming has been helpful in developing our portfolio website. Buttons
        and flex containers are apparent and widely utilized in constructing our site. These essential
        and repetitive objects are where OOP lies in making our website. If we deconstruct the backend
        of the site, OOCSS is sprinkled on different pages, primarily, as mentioned, in flex containers,
        which serve as bases on every page. We also utilized this in arranging our text containers and
        images. With no use of OOP, CSS codes will be redundant and lengthy. We have mostly applied the
        inheritance principle in our OOCSS but we have also added concepts of encapsulation by utilizing
        child classes to void its usage in other parts of our codes. It would also be more time-consuming
        in site development. As a form of practice, we also added bits of object oriented javascript to enhance
        our site's design and apply our lessons in the course through another language. Fortunately for us, our
        lessons were quite useful in applying javascript despite our focus during the term being in python.
        <br><br>Based on experience, OOP, like in literature, allows more concise structure. Repetitive objects
        like buttons, text styles, and containers can be conveniently reused and modified without excessive
        redundancy with the use of OOCSS. We have also noticed how the concepts of OOP can easily be applied
        despite being a different programming language. There were times we stumbled in debugging our site.
        But we noticed while using inspect elements to identify the problems, there were parts of the code
        inherited and it helped us look at the code better. With that, as coders, we can achieve better time
        efficiency. And a more concise code offers better readability and organization.</p>
